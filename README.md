# myPoster ‚Äì React.js & Vue.js Implementations

As part of the technical task for this application, I developed the **myPoster** app using both **React.js** and **Vue.js**.

## ‚öõÔ∏è React.js Version

**Live Demo:** [https://myposter-react-js.netlify.app/](https://myposter-react-js.netlify.app/)

I have solid experience with React and felt confident building this version. It reflects my understanding of component-based architecture, hooks, and modern frontend best practices.

## Vue.js Version

**Live Demo:** [https://myposter-vue-js.netlify.app/](https://myposter-vue-js.netlify.app/)

While I'm still early in my Vue.js journey, I challenged myself to rebuild the app using Vue to demonstrate adaptability and fast learning. To keep the development process consistent and straightforward, I did not follow Vue‚Äôs multi-word component naming convention and mirrored the same component structure and architecture used in the React version. This approach helped maintain clarity and alignment across both implementations.

## üëã Final Notes

Thank you for reviewing my work. I aimed to show both my competence in React and my willingness to learn and apply new frameworks like Vue. I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute and grow as part of your team.

Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
